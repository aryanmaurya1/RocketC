Simple library for CSV data manipulation and mathematical computation.<br>
<b><i>This library can be used in developing simple Machine Learning models from scratch.</i></b> 
<br>
<ul>
<h3>Features :</h3> 
<li>Provides basic linear algebra functionalities related to matrix manipulation like matrix dot product, summation, transpose, row sum, column sum etc. </li>
<li>Load CSV data into matrix.</li>
<li>Data containers and methods to modify loaded CSV data like drop columns, make data uniform, etc before converting it into numerical matrix.</li>
<li>Write matrix into CSV file.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Documentation of IO module is complete, currently it is written in source files above the functions and will be released in a seperate file in proper manner soon.
</p>
<i>
Documentation of Matrix and its related methods and functions is complete. They can be found in source code files above the function or method definition.
I am working on accumulating them in a sigle webpage.
